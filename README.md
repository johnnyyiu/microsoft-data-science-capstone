# Microsoft Data Science Capstone
The motivation of creating this notebook is a data science competition hosted by **Microsoft** and **DrivenData** on predicting poverty, which is a part of the Capstone project of the **Microsoft Professional Certificate in Data Science** and also my very first competition related to machine learning. By the end of the competition, I was at the **top 4%** on the leaderboard, and I am happy to share with you my approach, especially to those who are just beginning their journey on data science.
